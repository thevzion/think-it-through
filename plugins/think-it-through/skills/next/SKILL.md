name: next
description: Recommend the next one to three concrete actions with the highest leverage for the latest actionable result or current Binding. Use only when the user invokes next or asks what to do next; never redirect or act silently.

# ⚡ Think Next

**Use when:** The user has enough clarity to continue but needs the highest-leverage next step.
**Default binding:** The latest actionable result, otherwise the current Binding.
**Accepts:** A compatible HACP Working Object or the declared default material.
**Effect:** Recover the current stage and dependencies, identify the bottleneck, then rank concrete actions by leverage.
**Result:** One to three actions with expected outcomes.
**Duration:** One agent turn.
**Limits:** Distinguish conversational and external actions. Do not expand into a full plan or execute anything.

    A["Actionable result or Binding"] --> B["Recover stage and dependencies"]
    B --> C["Find highest-leverage bottleneck"]
    C --> D["Rank possible actions"]
    D --> E["Select one to three"]
    E --> F["Name action and expected outcome"]
    F --> G["User chooses whether to act"]
```

Prefer a reversible learning step when uncertainty is high.

## Format

Begin the combo trace with `> 🎯 **<binding>** → ⚡ **NEXT**`, followed by one to three `Next actions` ordered by leverage.

Add an output with `→` and presentation cards with `+`; show the trace once for the complete combo.
